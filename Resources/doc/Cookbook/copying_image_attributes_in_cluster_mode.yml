# This sample migration shows how to create a content with an ezimage field with the image being a copy of the ezimage
# field of another content, when the CMS is set up in cluster mode.

# 1. load the old content with the ezimage field and set a reference to the path of the image's original file.
#    In this case the name of the ezimage field is 'image'
-
    type: content
    mode: load
    match:
        location_remote_id: 123aremoteid456etc
    references:
        -
            identifier: old-path-ref
            attribute: attributes.image.path

# 2. fix the value we got, to obtain the actual path to the image file as found on disk.
#    In this case, the cms is installed in '/app', and the clusterized dfs-data dir is '/mnt/dfsdata/'
-
    type: php
    mode: call_function
    function: str_replace
    arguments: ['/app/ezpublish_legacy/', '/mnt/dfsdata/', 'reference:old-path-ref']
    references:
        new-path-ref: result

# 3. optional: check the value we got
#-
#    type: reference
#    mode: dump
#    identifier: "reference:new-path-ref"
#    label: 'absolute path of image file: '

# 4. create the new content.
#    In this case, the content class is called 'image', and its ezimage field is also called 'image'
