# Executing custom processes as migration steps

-
    type: process
    mode: run
    command: find # a string, or a reference. It should not include whitespace and options, as it will be escaped for security
    arguments: # an array of arguments
        - reference:someref # references will be resolved and escaped
        - '-type'
        - 'f'
    disable_output: false # bool, optional. Useful to save memory if the process creates a lot of output
    fail_on_error: false # bool, optional. Abort the migration if the external process fails (exits with a non-zero code)
    environment: [] # array, optional
    timeout: 86400 # integer, optional. Max process execution time in seconds (1 day by default)
    working_directory: '/somedir' #string, optional
    # The list in references tells the manager to store specific values for later use by other steps in the current migration.
    # NB: these are NEW VARIABLES THAT YOU ARE CREATING. They are not used in the current migration step!
    references: # Optional
        # short syntax:
        referenceId: attributeId # (possible values and meaning are explained for the 'long syntax')
        # long syntax:
        -
            identifier: referenceId # A string used to identify the reference
            attribute: # An attribute to get the value of for the reference. Supports: output, error_output, exit_code
            overwrite: true|false # Optional, default false. If not set, and the reference already exists, an exception is thrown
    if: # Optional. If set, the migration step will be skipped unless the condition is matched
        "reference:_ref_name": # name of a reference to be used for the test
            _operator_: value # allowed operators: eq, gt, gte, lt, lte, ne, count, length, regexp, satisfies
