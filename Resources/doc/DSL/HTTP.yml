    # Make an HTTP call
    # HttplugBundle will be used under the hood: it is an abstraction layer which allows to use different http clients
    # based on Symfony configuration
    type: http
    mode: call
    client: acme # The name of a client as configured in Sf config under httplug / clients.
                 # For info on how to set it up, see the notes below, as well as:
                 # http://docs.php-http.org/en/latest/integrations/symfony-bundle.html
    uri: http://a.web.site/hi/there # You can probably set up the hostname in the client config and only leave the url here
                                    # References will be replaced as long as they are in brackets, eg:
                                    # http://a.web.site/hi/there?param=[reference:my_ref]
    body: some-payload # String; optional. References will be resolved as long as they are in brackets
    headers: # array; optional. In case you want to send custom headers. NB: these can be set up in the configuration of the client as well
        X-something: value # string
    method: GET # string; optional. Defaults to GET
    # The list in references tells the manager to store specific values for later use by other steps in the current migration.
    # NB: these are NEW VARIABLES THAT YOU ARE CREATING. They are not used in the current migration step!
    references: # Optional
        # short syntax:
        referenceId: attributeId # (possible values and meaning are explained for the 'long syntax')
        # long syntax:
        -
            identifier: referenceId # A string used to identify the reference
            attribute: attributeId # An attribute to get the value of for the reference.
                                   # Supports: status_code, reason_phrase, protocol_version, body, body_size
            overwrite: true|false # Optional, default false. If not set, and the reference already exists, an exception is thrown
    if: # Optional. If set, the migration step will be skipped unless the condition is matched
        "reference:_ref_name": # name of a reference to be used for the test
            _operator_: value # allowed operators: eq, gt, gte, lt, lte, ne, count, length, regexp, satisfies

# *** Setting it up: ***
#
# 1. use Composer to require BOTH php-http/httplug-bundle and one of the http plug implementations, such as eg. php-http/curl-client
# 2. activate in your Kernel class the `Http\HttplugBundle\HttplugBundle` bundle
# 3. define in a configuration file an httplug client, eg:
#
# httplug:
#    plugins:
#        logger: ~
#    clients:
#        acme:
#            factory: 'httplug.factory.curl'
#            plugins:
#                - 'httplug.plugin.logger'
#                -
#                    header_defaults:
#                        headers:
#                            "X-FOO": bar
#                -
#                    authentication:
#                        acme_basic:
#                            type: 'basic'
#                            username: 'my_username'
#                            password: 'p4ssw0rd'
#            config:
#                CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST: false
#
# 4. you can now use the name of the client you defined in the migration 'http' steps
