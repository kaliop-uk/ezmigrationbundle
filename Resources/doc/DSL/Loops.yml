# Example: how to create a reference that holds a composite index of the current step in nested loops:

-
    type: loop
    repeat: 2
    steps:
        -
            type: reference
            mode: set
            identifier: loopindex1
            value: "[loop:iteration]"
            overwrite: true
        -
            type: loop
            repeat: 2
            steps:
                -
                    type: reference
                    mode: set
                    identifier: loopindex2
                    value: "[reference:loopindex1].[loop:iteration]"
                    overwrite: true
                -
                    type: reference
                    mode: dump
