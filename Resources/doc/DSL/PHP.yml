# Executing php functions or static class methods in yml migration definitions.
#
# NB: functions and methods using arguments by reference are untested - they might work or not at all.
# NB: atm there is no support for enforcing a given autoloading mechanism to ensure that the desired class or function are
#     available by the time the migration step is executed
#
# See also Services.yml for executing methods of Symfony services
