# Set this to 'false' if you do not want to update all the installed debian packages at the time of build in every container.
# Trick: you can change this to a different string and then run '...' to force a rebuild of the stack that will
# only include debian package updates. You could use f.e. a timestamp as value: 20180428
# NB: updating the base operating system is a good security practice, but it always comes with a risk of breaking things...
