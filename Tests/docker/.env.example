# A config file listing the environment variables which can be used to customize the build and execution of the Test Docker Stack
#
# The variables in this file are used  by docker-compose.yml, which in turn passes some of them down to the containers,
# both at build time and run time.
#
# In order to use this file, first copy it to one named '.env', then edit the copy:
# uncomment only the variables whose value you want to change.
#
# The default value for each variable is the one seen below (even though technically the actual default is set in docker-compose.yml).
#
# NB: if adding custom env vars check out out for possible naming conflicts: https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/envvars/

# The project name is used as prefix for the name of the containers that will be built.
# This allows to build and run different copies of the stack in parallel
#COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=kezmbtest

# Custom Timezone for the containers. Use 'none' as null value
#COMPOSE_TZ=none
###COMPOSE_TZ=Europe/London

# Use alternative debian mirrors when building 'surrogate/helper' containers. Useful if there are problems with the default mirrors
# Use 'none' as null value
#COMPOSE_DEBIAN_MIRROR=none
###COMPOSE_DEBIAN_MIRROR=http://cloudfront.debian.net/debian

# Use alternative debian versions to have different php versions onboard. Supported values: jessie, stretch, buster
#COMPOSE_DEBIAN_VERSION=buster

# Set this to 'false' if you do not want to update all the installed debian packages at the time of build in every container.
# Trick: you can change this to a different string and then run '...' to force a rebuild of the stack that will
# only include debian package updates. You could use f.e. a timestamp as value: 20180428
# NB: updating the base operating system is a good security practice, but it always comes with a risk of breaking things...
#COMPOSE_DO_UPDATE_OS=true

# Used for the subnet local to Docker.
# *NB*: UNUSED AT THE MOMENT
# *NB*: use only the first 3 bytes, as we assume a /24 subnet! No dot at the end.
# Note: private IP subnets go from 172.16.* to 172.31.*
# Note: if you change this value after building the stack once, the modified setting not have effect until:
#       1. you remove the network: `docker network rm kezmbtest_default`
#       2. you let docker recreate the network: ...
#       3. you attach all containers to the new network: ...
#COMPOSE_SUBNET=172.19.30

### Containers Runtime Settings

# Your user ID and group (as used on host computer) - used to eliminate file permissions problems between the containers
# and the host
#   On Ubuntu/Debian, the 1st user is generally 1000
#   To find out what your current IDs are, run the command `id`
#CONTAINER_USER_UID=1000
#CONTAINER_USER_GID=1000

### MySQL Settings
# NB: these are used when the db is created the 1st time the platform is executed. Changing them afterwards will have
# no effect (unless you delete the db data files)
#MYSQL_VERSION=5.6
#MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root_test
#MYSQL_USER=ezp
#MYSQL_PASSWORD=ezp
#MYSQL_DATABASE=behattestdb

### Settings used for running tests, including setup of eZ
# In file .travis.yml you can find other sets of values used for testing different versions of eZ
#SYMFONY_ENV=behat
#APP_ENV=behat
#EZ_PACKAGES=ezsystems/ezplatform:^2.5.0 ezsystems/ezplatform-xmltext-fieldtype:^1.8 ezsystems/behatbundle:^6.5 netgen/tagsbundle:^3.0 sensio/generator-bundle overblog/graphiql-bundle
#EZ_VERSION=ezplatform2
#KERNEL_CLASS=AppKernel
#KERNEL_DIR=vendor/ezsystems/ezplatform/app
#CODE_COVERAGE=0
#INSTALL_SOLRBUNDLE=0
#INSTALL_TAGSBUNDLE=1
